The Boyer-Moore algorithm is best for searching tweets because it can shift many indices in
the case of a mismatch. This is also the case for testRandomly(), where the vast majority of tests
show that this algorithm finds the match in the least amount of comparisons.

The KMP algorithm performs poorly on this data due to the high variation of characters used, thus the failure
links are being used more frequently. If the data consisted of repeated sequences of characters, 
this would probably be a more suitable algorithm.

The naive algorithm will almost always perform slowly unless if the text being searched is
equal or almost equal to the pattern used.
